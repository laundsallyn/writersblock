However, on his first day of class, he meets and befriends the mysterious transfer student, Miu F\u016brinji. Driven by his desire to become stronger and to protect those around him, he follows her to Ry\u014dzanpaku, a dojo where those who are truly strong and have mastered their arts gather (Ry\u014dzanpaku comes from the Chinese story of Heroes of the Water Margin who train together at Liangshan \u6881\u5c71). After learning basics from Miu, Kenichi is able to beat a high-ranking member of the school's karate club, and becomes a target for all the delinquents in the school. Kenichi's reason for training is to fulfill the promise he made to protect Miu. Subsequently, Kenichi's daily routine is divided between hellish training under the six masters of Ry\u014dzanpaku, and his fights against the members of Ragnarok, a gang that views him as either a possible ally or an impending threat to their plans.\n    After defeating Ragnarok, Kenichi faces a new enemy called Yomi, a group of disciples who are each personally trained by a master of an even bigger organization rivaling Ry\u014dzanpaku, Yami. While the masters of Ry\u014dzanpaku follow the principle of always sparing their opponents' lives (Katsujin-ken), the members of Yami believe that defeating an opponent is valid by any means including murder (Satsujin-ken). Caught in the struggle between the two factions, Kenichi, Miu and their ever growing team of allies join forces to fight the members of Yomi, while his masters confront the members of Yami in a battle to decide the future of the martial arts' world.(", "note": null, "series_works_count": "47", "primary_work_count": "47", "numbered": "true"}}}}}
