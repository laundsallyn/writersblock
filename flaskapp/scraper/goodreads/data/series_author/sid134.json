The series was created by a group of New Mexico science fiction authors, and mostly edited by George R. R. Martin.\n    \n    While most of the books are made up of individual short stories, they generally focus on a central theme or event. There were also several longer storylines which run through several of the books. Some volumes use the format of a mosaic novel. This involved several writers writing individual storylines which were then edited together into one novel length story. Finally, some volumes are a complete novel written by a single author.\n    \n    * <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56339-wild-cards-comics\">Wild Cards - Comics 1990</a>\n    * <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/56342-george-r-r-martin-s-wild-cards-comics\">George R.R.
