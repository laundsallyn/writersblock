Foucault gave us intellectual tools to understand these phenomena.\n    In Essential Works of Foucault 1954-1984 we use these very tools to understand his own work. Though he intended his books to be the core of his intellectual production, he is well known for having made strategic use of a number of genres-the book and the article to be sure, but also the lecture and the interview. Indeed, few modern thinkers have used such a wide array of forms in so skillful a fashion, making them an integral component in the development and presentation of their work. In this light, our aim in this series is to assemble a compelling and representative collection of Foucault's written and spoken words outside those included in his books.\n    Foucault died on June 25, 1984, at age fifty-seven, of AIDS, just days after receiving the first reviews of the second and third volumes of The History of Sexuality in the hospital. A year previous to his death, when he was showing no signs of illness, he had written a letter indicating that he wanted no posthumous publications; through the course of complex negotiations between those legally responsible to him, intellectually engaged with him, and emotionally close to him, it was decided that this letter constituted his will. He left behind, as far as we know, no cache of unpublished texts; we must conclude, then, that his papers were \"in order.\" Ten years later, Editions Gallimard published Dits et ecrits, well over three thousand pages of texts, organized chronologically. The editors, Daniel Defert and Francois Ewald, sought to collect all Foucault's published texts (his prefaces, introductions, presentations, interviews, articles, interventions, lectures, and so on) not included in his books. We have made a selection, eliminating overlapping or repetition of different versions of similar materials.\n    Likewise, a number of the lectures and courses will in time be published separately in English. What we have included in these three volumes are the writings that seemed to us central to the evolution of Foucault's thought. We have organized them thematically. Selecting from this corpus was a formidable responsibility that proved to be a challenge and a pleasure. Many of these texts were previously unavailable in English. In broad lines, the organization of the series follows one proposed by Foucault himself when he wrote: \"My objective has been to create a history of the different modes by which, in our culture, human beings are made subjects. My work has dealt with three modes of objectification which transform human beings into subjects.\"\n    In Volume One, following his course summaries from the College de France, which provide a powerful synoptic view of his many unfinished projects, the texts address \"the way a human being turns him- or herself into a subject.\"\n    Volume Two is organized around Foucault's analysis of \"the modes of inquiry which try to give themselves the status of the sciences.\" Science, for Foucault, was a domain of practices constitutive of experience as well as of knowledge.

Consequently, this volume treats the diverse modes of representations, of signs, and of discourse.\n    Finally, Volume Three contains texts treating \"the objectivizing of the subject in dividing practices,\" or, more generally, power relations.", "note": null, "series_works_count": "3", "primary_work_count": "3", "numbered": "true"}, "work": {"id": "751501", "best_book": {"id": "80386", "title": "Essential Works of Foucault (1954-84), Vol 2: Aesthetics, Method & Epistemology", "author": {"id": "1260", "name": "Michel Foucault"}, "image_url": "https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1328752488m/80386.jpg"}, "books_count": "3", "original_publication_day": null, "original_publication_month": null, "original_publication_year": "1998", "original_title": null, "ratings_count": "193", "ratings_sum": "803", "reviews_count": "516", "text_reviews_count": "6", "average_rating": null}}, {"id": "205477", "user_position": "2", "series": {"id": "52730", "title": "The History of Sexuality", "description": "Originally published as:\n    * Histoire de la Sexualit\u00e9\n    \n    Also known as:\n    * Cinselli\u011fin Tarihi\n    * Hist\u00f3ria da Sexualidade\n    * Historia de la Sexualidad\n    * Historia seksualno\u015bci\n    * Istorija seksualnosti\n    * Sejarah Seksualitas\n    * Sexualit\u00e4t und Wahrheit\n    * Storia della sessualit\u00e0\n    * \u6027\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\n    * \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0633\u06a9\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u062a\u0647", "note": null, "series_works_count": "4", "primary_work_count": "3", "numbered": "true"}, "work": {"id": "6928285", "best_book": {"id": "1878", "title": "The History of Sexuality 2: The Use of Pleasure", "author": {"id": "1260", "name": "Michel Foucault"}, "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}, "books_count": "36", "original_publication_day": null, "original_publication_month": null, "original_publication_year": "1983", "original_title": "Histoire de la Sexualit\u00e9 2: l'Usage des Plaisirs", "ratings_count": "2499", "ratings_sum": "10190", "reviews_count": "6903", "text_reviews_count": "63", "average_rating": null}}, {"id": "797599", "user_position": null, "series": {"id": "158086", "title": "Dits et \u00e9crits", "description": "1954-1988 Se\u00e7me Yaz\u0131lar.", "note": "Dits et \u00e9crits (1954-1988)", "series_works_count": "6", "primary_work_count": "6", "numbered": "false"}, "work": {"id": "44379503", "best_book": {"id": "24750462", "title": "\u00d6zne ve \u0130ktidar", "author": {"id": "1260", "name": "Michel Foucault"}, "image_url": "https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1422561219m/24750462.jpg"}, "books_count": "2", "original_publication_day": "1", "original_publication_month": "1", "original_publication_year": "2000", "original_title": null, "ratings_count": "6", "ratings_sum": "30", "reviews_count": "18", "text_reviews_count": "1", "average_rating": null}}, {"id": "756141", "user_position": "3", "series": {"id": "150083", "title": "Kunstklassiekers", "description": null, "note": null, "series_works_count": "19", "primary_work_count": "19", "numbered": "true"}, "work": {"id": "26416997", "best_book": {"id": "18626993", "title": "De mooiste meesterwerken van Bruegel (Kunstklassiekers, #3)", "author": {"id": "627387", "name": "Giovanni Arpino"}, "image_url": "https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1380916101m/18626993.jpg"}, "books_count": "1", "original_publication_day": "1", "original_publication_month": "1", "original_publication_year": "2004", "original_title": null, "ratings_count": "3", "ratings_sum": "11", "reviews_count": "4", "text_reviews_count": "0", "average_rating": null}}, {"id": "397299", "user_position": "3", "series": {"id": "83172", "title": "\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629", "description": null, "note": null, "series_works_count": "3", "primary_work_count": "3", "numbered": "true"}, "work": {"id": "3232031", "best_book": {"id": "1876", "title": "The History of Sexuality 3: The Care of the Self", "author": {"id": "1260", "name": "Michel Foucault"}, "image_url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}, "books_count": "31", "original_publication_day": null, "original_publication_month": null, "original_publication_year": "1984", "original_title": "Histoire de la Sexualit\u00e9 3: Le Souci de Soi", "ratings_count": "1522", "ratings_sum": "6182", "reviews_count": "4815", "text_reviews_count": "35", "average_rating": null}}, {"id": "244215", "user_position": "3", "series": {"id": "58439", "title": "Dits et \u00e9crits 1954-88 (4 volume)", "description": "En 4 volumes.

Foucault gave us intellectual tools to understand these phenomena.\n    In Essential Works of Foucault 1954-1984 we use these very tools to understand his own work. Though he intended his books to be the core of his intellectual production, he is well known for having made strategic use of a number of genres-the book and the article to be sure, but also the lecture and the interview. Indeed, few modern thinkers have used such a wide array of forms in so skillful a fashion, making them an integral component in the development and presentation of their work. In this light, our aim in this series is to assemble a compelling and representative collection of Foucault's written and spoken words outside those included in his books.\n    Foucault died on June 25, 1984, at age fifty-seven, of AIDS, just days after receiving the first reviews of the second and third volumes of The History of Sexuality in the hospital. A year previous to his death, when he was showing no signs of illness, he had written a letter indicating that he wanted no posthumous publications; through the course of complex negotiations between those legally responsible to him, intellectually engaged with him, and emotionally close to him, it was decided that this letter constituted his will. He left behind, as far as we know, no cache of unpublished texts; we must conclude, then, that his papers were \"in order.\" Ten years later, Editions Gallimard published Dits et ecrits, well over three thousand pages of texts, organized chronologically. The editors, Daniel Defert and Francois Ewald, sought to collect all Foucault's published texts (his prefaces, introductions, presentations, interviews, articles, interventions, lectures, and so on) not included in his books. We have made a selection, eliminating overlapping or repetition of different versions of similar materials.\n    Likewise, a number of the lectures and courses will in time be published separately in English. What we have included in these three volumes are the writings that seemed to us central to the evolution of Foucault's thought. We have organized them thematically. Selecting from this corpus was a formidable responsibility that proved to be a challenge and a pleasure. Many of these texts were previously unavailable in English. In broad lines, the organization of the series follows one proposed by Foucault himself when he wrote: \"My objective has been to create a history of the different modes by which, in our culture, human beings are made subjects. My work has dealt with three modes of objectification which transform human beings into subjects.\"\n    In Volume One, following his course summaries from the College de France, which provide a powerful synoptic view of his many unfinished projects, the texts address \"the way a human being turns him- or herself into a subject.\"\n    Volume Two is organized around Foucault's analysis of \"the modes of inquiry which try to give themselves the status of the sciences.\" Science, for Foucault, was a domain of practices constitutive of experience as well as of knowledge. Consequently, this volume treats the diverse modes of representations, of signs, and of discourse.\n    Finally, Volume Three contains texts treating \"the objectivizing of the subject in dividing
